        <h1>Demystifying <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_before.asp">::before</a></h1>
        <span>
            The ::before inserts content (specified in CSS) 
            before the content found inside the element in which you intend to insert said content.
            These can also be stylized further.
        </span>
        <p>We have seen in the title that the words "HTML &amp; CSS" have been set within CSS to appear before the content in the h1 tag.
           It is <strong><em><u>of paramount importance</u></em></strong> that you add the content property within the [element]::before ruleset
           otherwise the changes within said ruleset will simply be ignored. Note that you do not have to add text, thus you can leave the quotes empty. <br><br>

           <code>content: "";</code> <br><br>
           Anyways, you can use other styling properties such as padding, background-color (or background...), color, whatever you want! :)

                    <li>Microsoft Edge 8.0 might work too.</li>

        <h1>Demystifying <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_after.asp">::after</a></h1>
        <span>Works akin to ::before, except content is placed after the content within the element you wish to stylize using ::after.</span>
        <br>
        <span>For the sake of keeping the topic pertaining to software development, let's use a programming-related example...</span>
        
        <p>Statements in a great deal of programming languages must end with a semicolon... (such as Java, C#, et cetera...)</p>
        <span class="statement">Console.WriteLine("Hello World")</span>
        <p>
            We added a semicolon within the content property... and also increased the font-size as the semicolon is rather minuscule.
            Surely now it won't complain about a missing semicolon.
        </p>
        <span class="comment">int[] arr_int = new int[] {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}</span>
        <span>Now you should have an idea of what these selectors do. :) As usual, you are more than welcome to hit me up on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/lauren.winchester.1994">Messenger </a> if you still have trouble getting used to the content.
